# React Sticky Notes UI
Created with CodeSandbox.

A React sticky note app that allows users to create/delete notes, modify titles and descriptions, search for keywords in notes, and saves the current state to local storage. 

Adding the search functionality proved to be the most challenging aspect of this project because it involved utilizing event handlers/listeners as well as required me to map over the notes state. Although I have experience with both, applying these concepts to my React components took me some time to fully understand.
